        <p id="bio">Now that we are acquainted I'll tell you a bit about myself. I was born in Auburn Washington we moved to Iowa when I was young and I mostly grew up in Guthrie Center. Even though we didn\'t own a computer until I was almost out of the house I played Ken\'s Labrynth on my aunt\'s computer, this was before we had things like streaming or CD\'s! I started working as a cook at a restaurant when I was 16, and after moving back to Washington a few years ago I started a business with a former boss as the managing partner; This ended up being a good opportunity for self-evaluation and careful re-adjusting of my career direction. I decided to become a software developer back in mid 2018 and it took me a while to put my life in order before I enrolled at Code Fellows</p>
